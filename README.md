Hi, I'm Jessica Anderson and (most) of my portfolio should be on here.
My pronouns are she/her and as of writing this, I'm a BSc Cybersecurity student with the Open University.
I'm currently most interested in networking and network traffic analysis, which is funny because I was 100% convinced it would be the most boring part of my course.

Feel free to reach me with the contact details on my LinkedIn.
